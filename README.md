# ZMK Gamma

ZMK implementation of my gamma omega keyboard.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This makes use of my custom layout for my [piano keyboard](https://github.com/yves-biener/zmk-config) (18 keys) and mimics its behavior. This means that a lot of keys are not binded and serve for further testing if I would want to add further keys to my final design.
